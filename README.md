Stat Blocks for Custom NPCs
===========================

Statblocks for custom NPCs and Archetypes. Most NPCs use have stats for Battlesystem and regimental fights.

* Older statblocks use Valloric's <a href="https://valloric.github.io/statblock5e/">Statblock5e</a> library and must be viewed in Chrome.
* Newer statblocks use Markdown for Homebrewery.
