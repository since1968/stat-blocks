# Roguish Archetypes

### Stiletto
You pursue the art of close quarters fighting with light weapons. A Stiletto is just as likely to be a scholar or a noble as a soldier. You bring skill, knowledge, and deadly precision to the battlefield.

Disdaining any protection heavier than a gambeson and chamois gloves, Stiletti are often found in service of nobles, who pay stiletti to fight in their place. A Stileto can also be found training condottieri in the art of one-on-one combat, or gentlemen in the science of street fighting.

Some Stiletti are bookish, preferring to find their next maneuver in an obscure tome. Others are gregarious and just as likely to learn about pressure points from a Monk as they are to watch and study a Fighter’s parrying technique.

Common backgrounds for Stiletti are Noble, Mercenary Veteran, Sage, and Soldier.

#### Combat Superiority
At 3rd level, you gain a set of abilities that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

**Maneuvers.** You learn three basic maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed below.

You learn two additional basic maneuvers of your choice at 9th level, and two more at 13th level. Each time you learn new basic maneuvers, you can also replace one basic maneuver you know with a different one.

**Superiority Dice.** You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

You gain another superiority die at 9th level and one more at 13th level.

**Saving Throws.** Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

  **Maneuver Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

#### Grappler
Starting at 3rd level, you develop the skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters fighting. You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.

When you make an Attack action with a grapple, you can use a bonus action to attack with a light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. Other restrictions on Two-Weapon fighting still apply.

### Improved Combat Superiority
At 9th level, your superiority dice turn in to d10s. At 17th level, they turn into d12s.

On a failed save, the target is stunned until the end of your next turn.

In addition, whenever the creature takes damage it is stunned until the end of its next turn. The creature can end the condition by casting cure wounds or taking one round to stanch the bleeding.

If you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, you can delay that damage and immediately take a bonus turn, interrupting the current turn.

* If you have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.
* You do not need to expend a superiority die to feint as a bonus action.

When you sneak attack using a melee weapon and hit a creature, you deal an extra 100 points of damage. Once you use this maneuver, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

> #### Stiletto Playtesting Notes
> Unlike the Swashbuckler or the Inquisitive, the Stiletto has no “always on” sneak attack. The archetype is built around two techniques: setting up a sneak attack by imposing a short term condition like blindness, grappled, or stunned; and making sneak attacks during your opponent’s turn.
>
> The Stiletto is unlikely to be as strong as many of his opponents. If he hopes to grapple effectively he should take Expertise in Athletics at first level.
