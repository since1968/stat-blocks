    <property-block>
      <h4>Grappler.</h4>
      <p>Amazons have the skills necessary to hold their own in close quarters. An Amazon has advantage on attack rolls against a creature she is grappling. An Amazon can use her action to try to pin a creature grappled by her. To do so, make another grapole check. On success, she and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends.</p>
    </property-block>


    <property-block>
      <h4>Mounted Combatant.</h4>
      <p>Amazons are dangerous to face while mounted. While mounted and not incapacitated, the Amazon has advantage on melee attack rolls on any unmounted creature that is smaller than her mount. The Amazon can force an attack targeted at her mount to target her instead. If her mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw and only half damage if it fails.</p>
    </property-block>


    <property-block>
      <h4>Dismounted Sharpshooter.</h4>
      <p>Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls. Ranged weapon attack ignore half cover and three-quarters cover. The Amazon may choose to take a -5 penalty to a ranged weapon attack roll. If the attack hits, add +10 to the attack's damage. The Amazon only receives the Sharpshooter advantage when she is dismounted.</p>
    </property-block>

    <property-block>
      <h4>Martial Advantage.</h4>
      <p>The Amazon can deal an extra 4 (1d6) damage to a creature she hits with a melee weapon attack if that creature is within 5 feet of an ally of the Amazon that isn't incapacitated, and if that creature is a human, dragonborn or half-elf male.</p>
    </property-block>

    <property-block>
      <h4>Ares' Own Luck.</h4>
      <p>Once per day, when the Amazon makes a weapon attack roll against a creature, she can add 1d6 to the attack roll. She can use this maneuver before or after the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.</p>

    <h3>Battlesystem</h3>

    <property-block>
      <h4>Skirmisher.</h4>
      <p>The Amazon belongs to a <em>skirmisher</em> stand. Any Amazon stand pressed into service as a <em>regiment</em> has disadvantage on all morale checks. A broken Amazon stand will not rally.</p>
    </property-block>

    <property-block>
      <h4>Small Unit Integrity.</h4>
      <p>Amazons are trained to work in units comprised of a single stand and are not subject to disadvantage on attack rolls when isolated. All other rules on isolated units apply to Amazons.</p>
