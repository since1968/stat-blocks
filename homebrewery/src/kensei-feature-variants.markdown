# Class Feature Variants
These features replace or enhance the normal features of the monk Kensei. The feature variants each specify which feature they replace or enhance. If a feature is replaced, you gain no benefit from it and donâ€™t qualify for anything in the game that requires it. If a feature is enhanced, you continue to enjoy its benefits but now with new capabilities. 

If an existing feature with the same name has been modified to fit the Kensei, the modifications are shown in _italics_.

## Monk

### Monk Weapons
_1st-level monk feature (enhances Martial Arts)_

You can use this feature to define your monk
weapons, rather than using the definition in
Martial Arts.

You practice your martial arts with specially
chosen weapons, which become monk weapons
for you. You can choose a number of weapons to
be your monk weapons equal to 5 + your
Wisdom modifier (minimum of five weapons).
The chosen weapons must each meet the
following criteria:

* The weapon must be a simple or martial
weapon.
* You must be proficient with the weapon.
* The weapon must lack these properties: heavy,
special, or two-handed.

### Ki Features

When you gain the Ki feature at 2nd level, you

range from imposing disadvantage on your
attack rolls until the end of the current turn.

#### Quickened Healing

As an action, you can spend 2 ki points and roll a
Martial Arts die. You regain a number of hit
points equal to the number rolled.
