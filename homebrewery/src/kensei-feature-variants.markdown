## Kensei Feature Variants

These features replace or enhance the normal features of the monk Kensei. The feature variants each specify which feature they replace or enhance. If a feature is replaced, you gain no benefit from it and donâ€™t qualify for anything in the game that requires it. If a feature is enhanced, you continue to enjoy its benefits but now with new capabilities. 

If an existing feature with the same name has been modified to fit the Kensei, the modifications are shown in _italics_.
