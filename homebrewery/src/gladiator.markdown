# Fighter Archetypes

### Gladiator
For a gladiator, survival depends not only on strength and speed but also on glorious spectacle. Fighters who aspire to this archetype seek more than adventure and gold; they seek glory and victory. Lightly armored experts in close quarters fighting, gladiators disfavor reach weapons and ranged weapons unless thrown. 

#### Pit Fighter
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes, shields, and gladiator weapons, which are a gladius (short sword), spear, and trident. 

Your unarmed strikes use a d4 for damage. At 10th level, this die turns into d6. And at 18th level, it turns into d8.

Additionally, whenever an enemy tries to grapple you and fails, you may use your reaction to try to grapple the attacking creature back. Make new rolls for this attempt.

When you use a gladiator weapon that is not light, its damage die changes from a d6 to a d8, and from a d8 to a d10 when wielded with two hands.

In addition, you learn the Murmillo fighting style.

#### Murmillo Fighting Style
When a creature you can see attacks you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

If you are wielding a gladius (shortsword) and an attack affected by your Murmillo feature fails to hit, you may make a melee attack with your gladius as part of the same reaction.

Also, you gain a +1 bonus to AC when you are wearing light armor.

#### Bloody Entertainer
At 7th level, you gain Proficiency in the Performance and Intimidation skills.


#### Pit Master
At 10th level, you gain advantage on any grapple checks you make. 

Additionally, your spear becomes a reach weapon. Other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they enter the reach you have with that spear.


```
```

#### 15th level: Rapid Strike???
Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you have advantage on a weapon attack against a target on your turn, you can forgo that advantage to immediately make an additional weapon attack against the same target as a bonus action.

#### Strength Before Death
Starting at 18th level, your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death. If you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, you can delay that damage and immediately take a bonus turn, interrupting the current turn. You don’t take the damage until the bonus turn ends. It is possible to do things, such as gaining resistance, that change how much of that damage you take.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

# Appendix

### Design Notes
The Gladiator is intended for close quarters fighting against humanoids and may not perform as well against monstrosities or at range. The archetype owes more to [Brad Pitt in Troy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ62frK74u0) than to historical gladiators. Consider reskinning this as a myrmidon?

- Pit Fighter and Pit Master takes portions of the UA Spear Master feat and Polearm Master feat.
- Strength Before Death is the same as the 18th level Samurai feature.
- Unarmed strike damage is intended to stay several levels behind the Monk.
