## Artificer Specialist

Artificers pursue many disciplines. Here is a specialist option you can choose at 3rd level.

### Iron Man

Iron Man flavor text. 

#### Tool Proficiency
When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with smith's tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

#### Iron Man Spells
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Iron Man spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

##### Iron Man Spells
| Artificer Level | Spells |
|:-----:|:-------------|
| 3rd | _?_, _shield_ |
| 5th | _?_, _?_ |
| 9th | _fly_, _?_ |
| 13th | _?_, _?_ |
| 17th | _?_, _?_ |

But _jump_ is already on the artificer spell list. Jump at will at 5th level?

#### Man of Steel. Haw!

At 3rd level...

Suit of armor at this level. Temp HP to scale approximately with Steel defender

#### Extra Attack
Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Man in Motion
Starting at 5th level, you can cast _jump_ without expending a spell slot once per short rest as long as you are wearing your suit of Iron. Doing so does not require material components. 

#### 9th level fancy
At 9th level...

#### 15th level
At 15th level...
