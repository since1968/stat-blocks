## Martial Archetypes
At 3rd level, a fighter gains the Martial Archetype feature.

### Elven Archer
An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Among elves, Arcane Archers are some of their most elite warriors. These archers stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.

#### Arcane Arrow
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to channel magic into your attacks with a longbow or shortbow.

**Create Magic Arrow.** As a bonus action on your turn, you can create one magic arrow in your hand. The arrow lasts until the end of the turn or until it hits or misses a target. You can fire the arrow from a shortbow or longbow. The arrow is a magic weapon that deals an additional 2d6 force damage on a hit.

You have two uses of this feature, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

**Arcane Shot.** When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see the Arcane Shots section below). Whenever you create a magic arrow with this feature, you can apply the benefits of one of your Arcane Shot options to that arrow.

You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

```
```

#### Archer's Lore
At 3rd level, you learn a few skills relating to the typical duties of an Arcane Archer. You learn to understand magical theory and develop survival skills for wandering the wilds.
You gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, Athletics, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival.

#### Conjure Arrows
At 7th level, you learn a minor but useful magical trick. As an action, you can conjure 20 nonmagical arrows. The arrows appear in your hand or in a container, such as a quiver, on your body. The arrows remain for 10 minutes or until you use this feature again; they then vanish.

#### Careful Eyes
Starting at 7th level, you excel at picking out hidden enemies and other threats. You can take the Search action as a bonus action.

#### Steady Aim
At 10th level, your aim becomes deadly. As a bonus action on your turn, you can take careful aim at a creature you can see that is within range of a ranged weapon you're wielding. Until the end of this turn, your ranged attacks with that weapon gain two benefits against the target:

- The attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.
- On each hit, the weapon deals additional damage to the target equal to 2 + half your fighter level.

#### Close-Quarters Shooting
At 15th level, you learn to handle yourself in close combat. Making a ranged attack roll while within 5 feet of an enemy doesn’t impose disadvantage on your roll.

In addition, if you hit a creature within 5 feet of you with a ranged attack on your turn, that creature can’t take reactions until the end of this turn.

#### Deadly Arrow
At 18th level, your Arcane Arrow's bonus damage increases to 4d6 force damage.

#### Arcane Shots
The Arcane Arrow feature lets you choose Arcane Shot options at certain levels. The options are presented here in alphabetical order. These are all magical effects.

**Beguiling Arrow.** Your enchantment magic causes this arrow to temporarily beguile its target. Choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. If the arrow hits the target, the target can't attack the chosen ally or include that ally in a harmful area of effect until the end of your next turn. The target ignores this effect if it is immune to the charmed condition. This effect also ends if the chosen ally deals any damage to the target.

**Brute Bane Arrow.** You weave necromantic magic into your arrow. If a creature is hit by the arrow, any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage dealt by the creature's attacks is halved until the end of your next turn.


```
```


**Bursting Arrow.** You imbue your arrow with a blast of force energy drawn from the school of evocation. If you hit a creature with this arrow, each creature within 10 feet of it takes 2d6 force damage.

**Defending Arrow.** You use abjuration magic to weave a charm that disrupts your enemy's magic. A creature hit by this arrow suffers disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of your next turn.

**Grasping Arrow.** When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, thorny brambles that wrap around the target. The target hit by the arrow takes a -10 penalty to speed, and it takes 2d6 slashing damage if it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can touch it can use its action to try to remove the brambles, which requires a successful DC 10 Strength check. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute.

**Piercing Arrow.** You use transmutation magic to transform your arrow into an ethereal dart that passes through its targets. When you attack with this arrow, it fires forward in a line that is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long. You make a separate attack using your Arcane Arrow against each creature in that line.

**Seeking Arrow.** Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek out your target, allowing the arrow to curve and twist its path in search of its prey. As an action, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute, and make a ranged attack against it, using the Arcane Arrow. The arrow flies around corners if necessary, and this attack ignores three-quarters cover, half cover, and disadvantage caused by the target being out of sight or being at long range. The attack automatically misses if the target is out of the weapon's range or if there is no path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target. If the arrow hits its target, you know it, but you don't learn the target's location unless it's within your line of sight.

**Shadow Arrow.** You weave illusion magic into your arrow, causing it to occlude your foe's vision with grasping shadows. Until the end of your next turn, the target hit by the arrow can't see more than 30 feet away.
