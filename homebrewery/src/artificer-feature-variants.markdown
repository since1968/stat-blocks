## Artificer Feature Variants

Here you’ll find features that replace or enhance the normal features of the artificer. The class feature variants each specify which feature they replace or enhance. If a feature is replaced, you gain no benefit from it and don’t qualify for anything in the game that requires it. If a feature is enhanced, you continue to enjoy its benefits but now with new capabilities.

If an existing feature with the same name has been modified to fit the artificer, the modifications are shown in _italics_.

### Fighting Style
_10th-level artificer feature (replaces Magic Item Adept)_

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Archery

You gain a +2 bonus to attack folls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Defense

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting

When you roll a 1 or a 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

### Unarmed Fighting

_You have learned your foes' weak points._ Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength _or Intelligence modifier_. If you strike with two free hands, the d6 becomes d8.

When you successfully start a grapple, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature.

### Hitch Pitch
_11th-level artificer feature (replaces Spell-Storing Item)_

Bing bang.

### Smack Pack
_14th-level artificer feature (replaces Magic Item Savant)_

Bing bang.

## Artificer Spell List

The artificer spell list contains a new spell: _arcane weapon_.

#### Arcane Weapon
*1st-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You channel arcane energy into one simple or martial weapon you're holding, and choose one damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder. Until the spell ends you deal an extra 1d6 damage of the chosen type to any target you hit with the weapon. If the weapon isn't magical it becomes a magic weapon for the spell's duration.

As a bonus action, you can change the damage type, choosing from the options above.
