## Artificer Feature Variants

These features replace or enhance the normal features of the artificer. The class feature variants each specify which feature they replace or enhance. If a feature is replaced, you gain no benefit from it and donâ€™t qualify for anything in the game that requires it. If a feature is enhanced, you continue to enjoy its benefits but now with new capabilities. 

If an existing feature with the same name has been modified to fit the artificer, the modifications are shown in _italics_.

### Cantrip Versatility
_1st-level artificer feature (enhances Spellcasting)_

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.

### Fighting Style
_10th-level artificer feature (replaces Magic Item Adept)_

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Archery

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Defense

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting

When you roll a 1 or a 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Unarmed Fighting

_You have learned your foes' weak points._ Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength _or Intelligence modifier_. If you strike with two free hands, the d6 becomes d8.

When you successfully start a grapple, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature.

### Reliable Talent
_11th-level artificer feature (replaces Spell-Storing Item)_

By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Magical Secrets
_14th-level artificer feature (replaces Magic Item Savant)_

By _14th_ level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the _Artificer_ table, or a cantrip.

The chosen spells count as _artificer_ spells for you.

You learn two additional spells from any class at 18th level.


## Artificer Spell List

The artificer spell list contains a new spell: _arcane weapon_.

#### Arcane Weapon
*1st-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You channel arcane energy into one simple or martial weapon you're holding, and choose one damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder. Until the spell ends you deal an extra 1d6 damage of the chosen type to any target you hit with the weapon. If the weapon isn't magical it becomes a magic weapon for the spell's duration.

As a bonus action, you can change the damage type, choosing from the options above.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 8 hours.
