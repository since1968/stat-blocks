## Artificer Feature Variants

Here you’ll find features that replace or enhance the normal features of the artificer. The class feature variants each specify which feature they replace or enhance. If a feature is replaced, you gain no benefit from it and don’t qualify for anything in the game that requires it. If a feature is enhanced, you continue to enjoy its benefits but now with new capabilities.
