## Artificer Specialists

Artificers pursue many disciplines. Here is a specialist option you can choose at 3rd level.

#### Firearm Proficiency

Contra _Eberron: Rising from the Last War_ page 54, artificers are not proficient with firearms.

### Gunsmith

[Flavor text]

#### Battle Ready

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your combat training and your experiments with magic have paid off in two ways:

* You gain proficiency with martial weapons, including firearms.
* When you attack with a magic weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack and damage rolls.

#### Combat Superiority

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

**Maneuvers**. You learn eight maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under "Maneuvers" at the end of this document. You can only use one maneuver per attack.

You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 5th, 9th, and 15th level. 

**Superiority Dice**. You have six superiority dice, which are d4s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. 

You gain another superiority die at 9th level and 15th level. 

**Saving Throws**. Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence modifier (your choice)

#### Maneuver Versatility

You can replace one maneuver you know with a different maneuver whenever you finish a long rest. This change reflects your physical and mental preparation for the day ahead. Each time you learn new maneuvers you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

```
```

#### Expertise

At 3rd level, choose one of your skill proficiencies or one of your tool proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check that uses your chosen proficiency. 

At 6th level, you can choose one more of your proficiencies to gain this benefit.


#### Extra Attack
Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.


#### Close Quarters Shooter

You are trained in making ranged attacks at close quarters. Starting at 5th level, When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. Finally, you have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.

#### Improved Combat Superiority

At 5th level, your superiority dice turn into d6s. At 9th level, your superiority dice turn into d8s. At 15th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s.

Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.


#### Arcane Jolt

At 9th level, you learn new ways to channel arcane energy. When you hit a target with a magic weapon attack, you channel magical energy through the strike. The target takes an extra 2d6 force damage.

You can use this energy a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), but you can do so no more than once a turn. You regain all expended uses of your Arcane Jolt when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Improved Arcane Jolt

At 15th level, your Arcane Jolt becomes more powerful. The extra damage of your Arcane Jolt increases to 4d6.

## Infusions
The infusions presented are in addition to those found in _Eberron: Rising from the Last War._

#### Mechanized Armor
_Prerequisite: 6th-level artificer, Gunsmith specialist_

_Item: Breastplate armor_

Mechanized armor functions as Breastplate (medium) armor. While wearing mechanized armor:
* A  creature gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class.
* A creature may apply a maximum Dexterity modifier of 3 to its armor class, instead of 2. 
* The armor has hit points equal to your Constitution modifier + your Intelligence modifier + five times your level in this class. These hit points are treated as temporary hit points for the creature wearing the armor.
* **Repair (3/Day)**. You may use your bonus action to restore 2d8 + 2 hit points to the mechanized armor.

If the _mending_ spell is cast on it, the mechanized armor regains 2d6 hit points.

Your tinkering improves the lightness and durability of the mechanized armor. When you reach 10th level in this class: 
* Your mechanized armor gains a +2 bonus to Armor Class.
* The maximum Dexterity modifer increases to 5.
* **Deflect Attack**. The creature wearing the armor may use its reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll of one creature it can see. If the attack hits, the creature wearing the armor may halve the attack's damage against it.

When you reach 15th level in this class:
* Your mechanized armor gains a +3 bonus to Armor Class.
* Whenever your mechanized armor uses its Deflect Attack, the attacker takes force damage equal to 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature wearing the armor.

## Maneuvers
The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order. Unless the full text of a maneuver is provided here, each manuever is identical to those listed on page 74 of the _Player's Handbook_.

**Aim**. You carefully aim your next attack. As a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. Expend one superiority die and add the die to the attack roll. You can use this bonus action only if you haven’t moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.

<div class='descriptive'>
##### Steady, Fire, Aim!
Aim, unlike Precision Attack, consumes your Bonus Action and your movement. But it grants advantage _and_ adds a superiority die to the attack roll. Choose carefully! 
</div>   


**Ambush**. When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an initiative roll, you can expend one superiority die and add the die to the roll.

**Bait and Switch**. When you’re within 5 feet of an ally on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and switch places with that ally, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.

Roll the superiority die. Until the start of your next turn, the ally gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.

**Disarming Attack**. Per PHB.

**Evasive Footwork**. Per PHB.

**Feinting Attack**. Per PHB.

**Interception**. When a creature you can see hits a target that is within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your superiority die + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage).

**Menacing Attack**. Per PHB.

**Parry**. Per PHB.

**Precision Attack**. Per PHB.

**Rally**. Per PHB.

**Restraining Strike**. Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action to grapple the target (see chapter 9 in the _Player’s Handbook_ for rules on grappling). Add the superiority die to your Strength (Athletics) check. The target is also restrained while grappled in this way.

**Riposte**. When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee _or ranged_ weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the damage roll.

**Silver Tongue**. When you make a Charisma (Deception) check or a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can expend one superiority die, and add the superiority die to the ability check.

**Skirmish**. When an enemy you can see moves within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. Expend one superiority die and make one weapon attack against that creature. If the attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll. You may make the weapon attack before, during, or after your movement. 

**Snipe**. As a bonus action, you can expend one superiority die and make a ranged weapon attack. You can draw a thrown weapon as part of making this attack. If you hit, add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.

**Studious Eye**. When you make a Wisdom (Insight) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check, you can expend one superiority die, and add the superiority die to the ability check.

**Trip Attack**. Per PHB. 

<div class='descriptive'>
##### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat: "Un merdier très profond."
Several maneuvers allow you to make a ranged attack at close quarters. Standard rules for close quarters ranged attacks still apply unless you find a mechanism for overcoming disadvantage, such as _Close Quarters Shooter_ at 5th level or the _Crossbow Expert_ feat.
</div>   


## Firearms

Firearms are martial ranged weapons. 

When you discharge a firearm with the _long_ property within 5 feet of your target, you do so with disadvantage, even if you are trained as a Close Quarters Shooter or Crossbow Master.

You may use the butt of a firearm as an improvised melee weapon that deals 1d4 damage. You may treat the weapon as a club and use your proficiency bonus for the attack roll. This attack does not count as a magical attack, and you must use your Strength modifier to calculate damage.  


<div class='wide' style='margin-top:100px'>
##### Firearms
| Weapon | Level | Cost | Damage | Weight | Properties
|:------------- |:------|:------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| Revolver  | 3rd | 250 gp | 2d6 piercing | 3 lb. | Ammunition (range 40/120), reload (6 shots) |

## Design Notes for the Gunsmith aka "The Transporter"
### Inspiration

"I'm not getting killed for your merchandise. Buckle up."—The Driver

Pets suck. They're extra work to keep track of and they don't fit the flavor I'm looking for. The first version of the Gunsmith was a modified Battle Smith that removed _Steel Defender_ and added a variety of new and existing Battle Master maneuvers, with the following fiction for flavor inspiration:

* The Driver (Clive Owen) in BMW's The Hire series (https://youtu.be/GW11Lez4elc).
* Frank Martin (Jason Statham) in The Transporter (https://youtu.be/P5n8zY-vG4U).
* Roland the Gunslinger from the early Stephen King novellas—not the movie.
* ... with a bit of Mike Ehrmantraut thrown in.

The Steel Defender has two functional elements:

* Offensive. The pet attacks every round as a bonus action and deals a non-trivial amount of damage (see chart). Replace offensive features with maneuvers.
* Defensive. The pet absorbs a ton of damage (nearly 100 HP at 17th level!) Replace defensive features with mechanized armor infusions.

This specialist now dispenses entirely with the Battle Smith and builds a Gunsmith from the ground up.

### Suggested Backgrounds and Builds
Core elements of the persona: quick-witted, dexterous, mission-driven. The Gunsmith lives by a code and is seldom chaotically aligned. 

This build modifies the modern and Renaissance firearms from the _Dungeon Master's Guide_ page 268. Be careful about multiclass cheese! The Transporter is intended for play in Eberron and might not fit well in the Forgotten Realms.

The following Dragonmarks are a good fit for the Gunsmith: the Mark of Finding, the Mark of Making, the Mark of Passage, the Mark of Sentinel, and the Mark of Warding.

Consider the following backgrounds for your character: House Agent, Mercenary Veteran, Veteran Bounter Hunter, Soldier, Charlatan, Criminal, Urchin, City Watch, Faction Agent, or Transporter (see attached). 


```
```

### Compared to the Battle Master
A Gunsmith should not be able to out-fight a fighter, but he should be able to outwit him. Use the Gunsmith's superiority dice to provide a flexible & creative play-style at the expense of raw power.

In the following tables "Damage per Short Rest" represents the sum of the average marginal damage provided exclusively by superiority dice. Fighter 15th and 18th level assumes one battle per short rest in which the fighter is out of dice. The sum assumes that every attack hits.

##### Battle Master Maneuvers
| Level | Maneuvers | dSize | Dice | Dmg / Short Rest
|:----:|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| 3rd  | 3 |d8 |4 | 18 |
| 7th  | 5 |d8 |5 | 22.5 |
| 10th | 7 |d10 |5 | 27.5 |
| 15th | 9 |d10 |6† | 38.5 |
| 18th | 9 |d12 |6 | 45.5 |

† Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.

##### Gunsmith Maneuvers
| Level | Maneuvers | dSize | Dice | Dmg / Short Rest
|:----:|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| 3rd  | 8 |d4 |6 | 15 |
| 5th  | 10 |d6 |6 | 21 |
| 9th | 12 |d8 |6 | 27 |
| 15th | 14 |d10 |6† | 38.5 |

† Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.

### Compared to the Steel Defender
Are maneuvers are underpowered compared to the Steel Defender?

##### Steel Defender Stats
| Level | HP | Rend Dmg / Rnd | Dmg / Short Rest
|:----:|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| 3rd  | 20 |6 | 60 |
| 5th  | 27 |7 | 70 |
| 9th | 54 |17 | 170 |
| 13th | 75 |18 | 180 |
| 15th | 85 |25 | 250 |
| 17th | 96 |26 | 260 |

Assumptions:
* Artificer INT of 16 at 3rd level, 18 at 5th level, and 20 at 9th level.
* Rend takes your bonus action. Assumes 10 attacks per short rest.
