# Bard College

## Skáld 

Warrior-poets whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, Skálds never shy from the front-line of battle.

### Bonus Proficiencies

When you become a Skáld at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and shields. 

### Fighting Style

At 3rd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the options at the end of this document. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Combat Inspiration

Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A create that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll i just made. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.

### Extra Attack

Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Inspiring Leader

Starting at 14th level, you can spend 10 minutes inspiring your companions, shoring up their resolve to fight. When you do so, choose up to six friendly creatures (which can include yourself) within 30 feet of you who can see or hear you and who can understand you. Each creature can gain temporary hit points equal to your level + your Charisma modifier. A creature can't gain temporary hit points from this feat again until it has finished a short or long rest.

## Fighting Styles

### Fell-Handed

You master the handaxe, battleaxe, greataxe, warhammer, and maul. _You become proficient with these weapons if you are not already, and_ you gain the following benefits when using any of them:

* You gain a +1 bonus to attack _and damage_ rolls you make with the weapon.
* Whenever you have advantage on a melee attack roll you make with the weapon and hit, you can knock the target prone if the lower of the two d20 rolls would also hit the target.
* Whenever you have disadvantage on a melee attack roll you make with the weapon, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of 0) if the attack misses but the higher of the two d20 rolls would have hit.
* If you use the Help action to aid an ally’s melee attack while you’re wielding the weapon, you knock the target’s shield aside momentarily. In addition to the ally gaining advantage on the attack roll, the ally gains a +2 bonus to the roll if the target is using a shield.

### Blade Mastery

You master the shortsword, longsword, scimitar, rapier, and greatsword. _You become proficient with these weapons if you are not already, and_ you gain the following benefits when using any of them:

* You gain a +1 bonus to attack _and damage_ rolls you make with the weapon.
* On your turn, you can use your reaction to assume a parrying stance, provided you have the weapon in hand. Doing so _adds your proficiency_ bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn or until you’re not holding the weapon.
* When you make an opportunity attack with the weapon, you have advantage on the attack roll.

### Spear Mastery

Though the spear is a simple weapon to learn, it rewards you for the time you have taken to master it. _You become proficient with the spear if you are not already, and_ you gain the following benefits.

* You gain a +1 bonus to attack _and damage_ rolls you make with a spear.
* When you use a spear, its damage die changes from a d6 to a d8, and from a d8 to a d10 when wielded with two hands. (This benefit has no effect if another feature has already improved the weapon’s die.)
* You can set your spear to receive a charge. As a bonus action, choose a creature you can see that is at least 20 feet away from you. If that creatures moves within your spear’s reach on its next turn, you can make a melee attack against it with your spear as a reaction. If the attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 piercing damage, or an extra 1d10 piercing damage if you wield the spear with two hands. You can’t use this ability if the creature used the Disengage action before moving.
* As a bonus action on your turn, you can increase your reach with a spear by 5 feet for the rest of your turn.
