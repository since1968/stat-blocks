# Bard College

## Skáld 

Warrior-poets whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, Skálds never shy from the front-line of battle.

### Bonus Proficiencies

When you become a Skáld at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and shields. You also gain proficiency with Animal Handling.

### Fighting Style

At 3rd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the options at the end of this document. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.


### Rally

Also at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action and expend one Bardic Inspiration die to bolster the resolve of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature _regains hit points_ equal to the Bardic Inspiration die roll + your Charisma modifier. 

### Extra Attack

Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Inspiring Leader

Also at 6th level, you can spend 10 minutes inspiring your companions, shoring up their resolve to fight. When you do so, choose up to six friendly creatures (which can include yourself) within 30 feet of you who can see or hear you and who can understand you. Each creature can gain temporary hit points equal to your level + your Charisma modifier. A creature can't gain temporary hit points from this feat again until it has finished a short or long rest.

### Ride to Ruin and the World's End

Starting at 14th level, you can drive your allies to fight with abandon. As a bonus action, you may shout a battle-cry. Choose up to six friendly creatures (which can include yourself) who can hear and understand you. Each creature can decide to attack recklessly on the first attack of its turn. Doing so gives them advantage on ability checks using Strength or melee weapon attack roles during this turn, but attack rolls against them have advantage until their next turn. This effect lasts for one minute. A creature cannot be affected by this battle-cry again until it has finished a short or long rest.

## Fighting Styles


### Blade Mastery

You master the shortsword, longsword, scimitar, rapier, and greatsword. _You become proficient with these weapons if you are not already, and_ you gain the following benefits when using any of them:

* You gain a +1 bonus to attack _and damage_ rolls you make with the weapon.
* On your turn, you can use your reaction to assume a parrying stance, provided you have the weapon in hand. Doing so _adds your proficiency_ bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn or until you’re not holding the weapon.
* When you make an opportunity attack with the weapon, you have advantage on the attack roll.



### Fell-Handed

You master the handaxe, battleaxe, and greataxe. _You become proficient with these weapons if you are not already, and_ you gain the following benefits when using any of them:

* You gain a +1 bonus to attack _and damage_ rolls you make with the weapon.
* Whenever you have advantage on a melee attack roll you make with the weapon and hit, you can knock the target prone if the lower of the two d20 rolls would also hit the target.
* Whenever you have disadvantage on a melee attack roll you make with the weapon, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of 0) if the attack misses but the higher of the two d20 rolls would have hit.
* _If a creature moves 5 feet or more while within your reach, you may use your reaction to attempt to knock the creature prone by attacking with your axe handle. If you hit with the attack, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. If the target is knocked prone, its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its current turn_.

##### An equal and opposite...
No reaction in the game beats Lore bard's _cutting words_. Fighting styles provide strong reaction options to the Skáld if he's willing to wade into battle.

### Spear Mastery

Though the spear is a simple weapon to learn, it rewards you for the time you have taken to master it. _You become proficient with the spear if you are not already, and_ you gain the following benefits.

* You gain a +1 bonus to attack _and damage_ rolls you make with a spear.
* When you use a spear, its damage die changes from a d6 to a d8, and from a d8 to a d10 when wielded with two hands. (This benefit has no effect if another feature has already improved the weapon’s die.)
* _When a creature enters_ your spear’s reach on its next turn, you can make a melee attack against it with your spear as a reaction. If the attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 piercing damage, or an extra 1d10 piercing damage if you wield the spear with two hands. You can’t use this ability if the creature used the Disengage action before moving.
* As a bonus action on your turn, you can increase your reach with a spear by 5 feet for the rest of your turn.
