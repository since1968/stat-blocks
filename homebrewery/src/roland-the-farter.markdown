### Roland the Farter
Roland the Farter has been the center of attention since before he could walk, and once he learned to sing and fart, he never surrendered the spotlight again. And who deserves it more than him?

Roland travels with a troupe of seven entertainers (actually a mix of **bandit captains** and thieves) in a battle wagon. His troupe pilfers the audience while he performs. If caught, he is reluctant to fight, preferring to slip away via misty step, grease, and noxious cloud (in a pinch).

> #### The Real Roland
> "Roland, court minstrel to 12th century English king Henry II, probably had many talents.
>
> "But history has recorded only one.
>
> "Referred to variously Rowland le Sarcere, Roland le Fartere, Roland le Petour, and Roland the Farter, Roland really had a single job in the court: Every Christmas, during the court’s riotous pageant, he performed a dance that ended with “one jump, one whistle, and one fart”, executed simultaneously.
>
> "For this, Roland was gifted a manor house in Hemingstone, Suffolk, and more than 100 acres of land. _For farting on cue_."
>
> **Atlas Obscura**

### Sources
You can read about the real Roland at [Atlas Obscura](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-true-story-of-roland-the-farter-and-how-the-internet-killed-professional-flatulence). Any errors in abstracting the ancient art of farting on demand for D&D are mine alone.

Roland is built as a College of Satire Bard from UA [Kits of Old](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/unearthed-arcana/kits-old). I have loved this NPC ever since Dragon Magazine [Issue 60](https://annarchive.com/files/Drmg060.pdf) introduced the Jester for AD&D.
