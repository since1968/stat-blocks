## Artificer Class Features
Class feature variants each specify which feature they replace or enhance. If a feature is replaced, you gain no benefit from it and don’t qualify for anything in the game that requires it. If a feature is enhanced, you continue to enjoy its benefits but now with new capabilities.

### Combat Superiority
_3rd-level artificer feature (replaces Steel Defender)_

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

**Maneuvers**. You learn [three] maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under "Maneuvers" at the end of this document. You can only use one maneuver per attack.

You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at [5th, 9th, and 15th level]. Each time you learn new maneuvers you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

**Superiority Dice**. You have [four] superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. 

You gain another superiority die at 5th level, 9th level and 15th level. 

**Saving Throws**. Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence modifier (your choice)

### Maneuver Versatility
_3rd-level feature (enhances Maneuvers)_

If you know any maneuvers from the artificer's Battle Smith archetype, you can replace one maneuver you know with a different maneuver whenever you finish a long rest. This change reflects your physical and mental preparation for the day ahead.


### Close Quarters Shooter
_5th-level artificer feature (enhances Battle Ready)_

You are trained in making ranged attacks at close quarters. When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. Finally, you have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.

### Improved Combat Superiority
_9th- and 15th-level artificer features (replaces Arcane Jolt and Improved Defender)_

At 9th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 15th level, your superiority dice turn into d12s.

   
### Maneuvers
The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order. Unless the full text of a maneuver is provided here, each manuever is identical to those listed on page 74 of the _Player's Handbook_.

**Ambush**. When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an initiative roll, you can expend one superiority die and add the die to the roll.

**Bait and Switch**. When you’re within 5 feet of an ally on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and switch places with that ally, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.

Roll the superiority die. Until the start of your next turn, the ally gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.

**Disarming Attack**. Per PHB.

**Evasive Footwork**. Per PHB.

**Feinting Attack**. Per PHB.

**Interception**. When a creature you can see hits a target that is within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your superiority die + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage).

**Menacing Attack**. Per PHB.

**Precision Attack**. Per PHB.

**Rally**. Per PHB.

**Restraining Strike**. Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action to grapple the target (see chapter 9 in the _Player’s Handbook_ for rules on grappling). Add the superiority die to your Strength (Athletics) check. The target is also restrained while grappled in this way.

**Riposte**. When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee _or ranged_ weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the damage roll.

##### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat: "Un merdier très profond."
Several maneuvers allow you to make a ranged attack at close quarters. Standard rules for close quarters ranged attacks still apply unless you find a mechanism for overcoming disadvantage, such as _Close Quarters Shooter_ at 5th level or the _Crossbow Expert_ feat.
</div>

**Silver Tongue**. When you make a Charisma (Deception) check or a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can expend one superiority die, and add the superiority die to the ability check.

**Skirmish**. When an enemy you can see moves within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. Expend one superiority die and make one weapon attack against that creature. If the attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll. You may make the weapon attack before, during, or after your movement. 

**Snipe**. As a bonus action, you can expend one superiority die and make a ranged weapon attack. You can draw a thrown weapon as part of making this attack. If you hit, add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.

**Studious Eye**. When you make a Wisdom (Insight) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check, you can expend one superiority die, and add the superiority die to the ability check.

**Trip Attack**. Per PHB.

## Design Notes for the Customized Battle Smith aka "The Transporter"
### Inspiration

"I'm not getting killed for your merchandise. Buckle up."—The Driver

Pets suck. They're extra work to keep track of and they don't fit the flavor I'm looking for. I've updated the Battle Smith by removing _Steel Defender_ and adding a variety of new and existing Battle Master maneuvers, with the following fiction for flavor inspiration:

* The Driver (Clive Owen) in BMW's The Hire series (https://youtu.be/GW11Lez4elc).
* Frank Martin (Jason Statham) in The Transporter (https://youtu.be/P5n8zY-vG4U).
* Roland the Gunslinger from the early Stephen King novellas—not the movie.
* ... with a bit of Mike Ehrmantraut thrown in.

### Suggested Backgrounds and Feats
Core elements of the persona: quick-witted, dexterous, mission-driven. The Battle Smith lives by a code and is seldom chaotically aligned. 

This build assumes your DM allows modern or Renaissance firearms per the _Dungeon Master's Guide_ page 268. For balance, the player should not be allowed a third attack by multiclassing to 11th level fighter. The Transporter is intended for play in Eberron and might not fit well in the Forgotten Realms.

```
```

### Compared to the Battle Master
A Battle Smith should not be able to out-fight a fighter, but he should be able to outwit him. Use the Battle Smith's superiority dice to provide a flexible & creative play-style at the expense of raw power.

In the following tables "Damage per Short Rest" represents the sum of the average marginal damage provided exclusively by superiority dice. Fighter 15th and 18th level assumes one battle per short rest in which the fighter is out of dice. The sum assumes that every attack hits.

##### Battle Master Maneuvers
| Level | Maneuvers | dSize | Dice | Dmg / Short Rest
|:----:|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| 3rd  | 3 |d8 |4 | 18 |
| 7th  | 5 |d8 |5 | 22.5 |
| 10th | 7 |d10 |5 | 27.5 |
| 15th | 9 |d10 |6† | 38.5 |
| 18th | 9 |d12 |6 | 45.5 |

† Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.

##### Battle Smith Maneuvers
| Level | Maneuvers | dSize | Dice | Dmg / Short Rest
|:----:|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| 3rd  | 5 |d4 |6 | 15 |
| 5th  | 7 |d6 |6 | 21 |
| 9th | 9 |d8 |6 | 27 |
| 15th | 11 |d10 |6† | 38.5 |

† Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.

### Compared to the Steel Defender
Maneuvers are underpowered compared to the Steel Defender!

##### Steel Defender Stats
| Level | HP | Rend Dmg / Rnd | Dmg / Short Rest
|:----:|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| 3rd  | 20 |6 | 60 |
| 5th  | 27 |7 | 70 |
| 9th | 54 |17 | 170 |
| 13th | 75 |18 | 180 |
| 15th | 85 |25 | 250 |
| 17th | 96 |26 | 260 |

Assumptions:
* Artificer INT of 16 at 3rd level, 18 at 5th level, and 20 at 9th level.
* Rend takes your bonus action. Assumes 10 attacks per short rest.

> Balance issues: don't give artificer bigger superiority dice earlier than battle master. 
> 
> Consider starting with d4, d6, d8, d10, more known maneuvers from a shorter list. Consider having more superiority dice since that metal dog does something every round. Average of 6.5 DPR with every single bonus action!
