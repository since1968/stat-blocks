# Class Feature Variants

Here you’ll find features that replace or enhance the normal features of your character’s class. The class feature variants each specify which feature they replace or enhance. If a feature is replaced, you gain no benefit from it and don’t qualify for anything in the game that requires it. If a feature is enhanced, you continue to enjoy its benefits but now with new capabilities.

## Artificer
An artificer has access to the following features.

### Combat Superiority
_3rd-level artificer feature (replaces Steel Defender)_

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

*Maneuvers*. You learn [three] maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under "Maneuvers" at the end of this document. You can only use one maneuver per attack.

You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at [5th, 9th, and 15th level]. Each time you learn new maneuvers you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

*Superiority Dice*. You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. 

You gain another superiority die at 5th level, 9th level and 15th level. 

*Saving Throws*. Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

*Maneuver save DC* = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence modifier (your choice)

#### Improved Combat Superiority
At 9th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 15th level, your superiority dice turn into d12s.
