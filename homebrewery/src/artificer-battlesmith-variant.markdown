## Artificer Class Feature Variants
An artificer has access to the following features. The class feature variants each specify which feature they replace or enhance. If a feature is replaced, you gain no benefit from it and don’t qualify for anything in the game that requires it. If a feature is enhanced, you continue to enjoy its benefits but now with new capabilities.


### Combat Superiority
_3rd-level artificer feature (replaces Steel Defender)_

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

**Maneuvers**. You learn [three] maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under "Maneuvers" at the end of this document. You can only use one maneuver per attack.

You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at [5th, 9th, and 15th level]. Each time you learn new maneuvers you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

**Superiority Dice**. You have [four] superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. 

You gain another superiority die at 5th level, 9th level and 15th level. 

**Saving Throws**. Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence modifier (your choice)

#### Improved Combat Superiority
At 9th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 15th level, your superiority dice turn into d12s.

### Maneuver Versatility
_3rd-level feature (enhances maneuvers)_
If you know any maneuvers from the fighter’s Battle Master archetype or the artificer's Battle Smith archetype, you can replace one maneuver you know with a different maneuver whenever you finish a long rest. This change reflects your physical and mental preparation for the day ahead.

   
### Maneuvers
The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order. Unless the full text of a maneuver is provided here, each manuever is identical to those listed in the _Player's Handbook_ page 74.

**Ambush**. When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an initiative roll, you can expend one superiority die and add the die to the roll.

**Bait and Switch**. When you’re within 5 feet of an ally on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and switch places with that ally, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.

Roll the superiority die. Until the start of your next turn, the ally gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.

**Brace**. When an enemy you can see moves within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to expend one superiority die and make one weapon attack against that creature. If the attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.

> Balance issues: don't give artificer bigger superiority dice earlier than battle master. 
> 
> Consider starting with d4, d6, d8, d10, more known maneuvers from a shorter list. Consider having more superiority dice since that metal dog does something every round.
