# Divine Domains
At 1st level, a cleric gains the Divine Domain feature.

### Radiant Forge Domain
The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to teh mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities search for objects lost ot the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items.

##### Forge Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:-----:|:-------------|
| 1st | Domain Spells, Bonus Proficiencies, Blessing of the Forge |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Artisan's Blessing |
| 6th | Soul of the Forge |
| 8th | Divine Strike (1d8) |
| 14th | Divine Strike (2d8) |
| 17th | Saint of Forge [and Fire] |

What about allowing him to swap out radiant damage for fire damage at the beginning of the day?

#### Domain Spells

#### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and smith's tools.

#### Blessing of the Forge
At 1st level, you gain the ability to imbue magic into a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armor or simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it's armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it's a weapon. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Channel Divinity: Artisan's Blessing
[create item? or +10 to hit?]

#### Soul of the Forge
Starting at 6th level, your mastery of the forge grants you special abilities:

* You gain resistance to fire damage.
* While wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the power of the forge. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 [radiant] damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

#### Saint of Forge and Fire
At 17th level, your blessed affinity with fire and metal becomes more powerful:

* You gain immunity to fire damage.
* While wearing heavy armor, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

### Design Notes

The Radiant Forge Domain adjusts the Forge Domain from Xanathar's Guide to make it more playable in Descent to Avernus, where fiends have resistance or immunity to fire damage.

Changes:

* Divine Strike: replaced _fire_ damage with _radiant_ damage.
