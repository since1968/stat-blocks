### Radiant Forge Domain
The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to teh mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities search for objects lost ot the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items.

#### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and smith's tools. Additionally, you gain spear mastery.

#### Spear Mastery
You gain the following benefits when you wield a spear:
* You gain a + 1 bonus to attack rolls you make with a spear.
* When you use a spear its damage die changes from a d6 to a d8, and from a d8 to a d10 when wielded with two hands.
* You can set your spear to receive a charge. As a bonus action, choose a creature you can see that is at least 20 feet away from you. If that creature moves within your spear's reach on its next turn, you can make a melee attack against it with your spear as a reaction. If the attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 piercing damage, or an extra 1d10 piercing damage if you wield the spear with two hands. You can't use this ability if the creature used the Disengage action before moving.
* As a bonus action on your turn, you can increase your reach with a spear by 5 feet for the rest of your turn.


```
```


#### Blessing of the Forge
At 1st level, you gain the ability to imbue magic into a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armor or simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it's armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it's a weapon. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.


#### Channel Divinity: Radiance of the Forge
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness the energy of the forge, banishing darkness and dealing radiant damage to your foes.

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.

#### Soul of the Forge
Starting at 6th level, your mastery of the forge grants you special abilities:

* You gain resistance to fire damage.
* While wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the power of the forge. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 3d6.

#### Saint of Forge and Fire
At 17th level, your blessed affinity with fire and metal becomes more powerful:

* You gain immunity to fire damage.
* While wearing heavy armor, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

> #### Playtesting Notes
> My goal was to make this cleric a more effective combatant in Avernus, where most creatures will resist fire damage, by adding paladin attack spells and radiant damage while preserving most of the flavor of the original. Spear mastery and heavy armor points this PC to a strength build.
> 
> To Do: swap out _fabricate_ for something more fun.
