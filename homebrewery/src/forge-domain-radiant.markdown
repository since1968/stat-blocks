# Divine Domains
At 1st level, a cleric gains the Divine Domain feature.

### Radiant Forge Domain
The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to teh mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities search for objects lost ot the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items.

#### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and smith's tools.

#### Blessing of the Forge
At 1st level, you gain the ability to imbue magic into a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armor or simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it's armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it's a weapon. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Channel Divinity: Radiance of the Forge
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness the energy of the forge, banishing darkness and dealing radiant damage to your foes.

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.

#### Soul of the Forge
Starting at 6th level, your mastery of the forge grants you special abilities:

* You gain resistance to fire damage.
* While wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the power of the forge. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

#### Saint of Forge and Fire
At 17th level, your blessed affinity with fire and metal becomes more powerful:

* You gain immunity to fire damage.
* While wearing heavy armor, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

### Design Notes

The Radiant Forge Domain adjusts the Forge Domain from Xanathar's Guide to make it more playable in Descent to Avernus, where fiends have resistance or immunity to fire damage.

Thematic changes: raid the paladin's spell list for spells that fit the new flavor; reduced focus on fabrication.

Changes:

* Channel divinity: replaced _artisan's blessing_ with _radiance of the dawn_ from Light Domain. Reflavored.
* Domain spell: replaced _searing smite_ with _wrathful smite_. Is psychic damage a little off-brand?
* Domain spell: replaced _magical weapon_ with _branding smite_.
* Domain spell: replaced _elemental weapon_ with _blinding smite._ Super on-point for new flavor.
* Domain spell: replaced _creation_ with _destructive wave_.
* Divine Strike: replaced _fire_ damage with _radiant_ damage. 

### To Do

* Decide whether to keep _wall of fire_. Great spell, might not work well in Avernus.
* Decide whether to keep _fabricate_. Crummy spell, on point tho.
