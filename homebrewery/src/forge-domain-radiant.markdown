### Radiant Forge Domain
The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to teh mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities search for objects lost ot the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items.

#### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and smith's tools.

#### Blessing of the Forge
At 1st level, you gain the ability to imbue magic into a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armor or simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it's armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it's a weapon. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

> #### Playtesting Notes
> The Radiant Forge Domain was adapted from the Forge Domain in _Xanathar's Guide_. I stripped most of the fabrication flavor and raided the Paladin spell list for offensive spells. _Radiance of the Forge_ is lifted from the Light Domain's Channel Divinity feature. My goal was to make this cleric a more effective combatant in Avernus, where most creatures will resist fire damage, while preserving most of the flavor of the original. 
> 
> To Do: swap out _fabricate_ for something more fun.

#### Channel Divinity: Radiance of the Forge
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness the energy of the forge, banishing darkness and dealing radiant damage to your foes.

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.

#### Soul of the Forge
Starting at 6th level, your mastery of the forge grants you special abilities:

* You gain resistance to fire damage.
* While wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the power of the forge. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

#### Saint of Forge and Fire
At 17th level, your blessed affinity with fire and metal becomes more powerful:

* You gain immunity to fire damage.
* While wearing heavy armor, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.
