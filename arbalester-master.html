    <property-block>
      <h4>Crossbow Expert.</h4>
      <p>The master arbalester ignores the loading property of a heavy crossbow. Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature does not impose disadvantage on a ranged attack roll.</p>
    </property-block>


    <property-block>
      <h4>Martial Advantage.</h4>
      <p>The master arbalester has advantage on a ranged attack roll against a creature if at least one of the master arbalester's allies is within 5 feet and isn't incapacitated.</p>
    </property-block>


    <property-block>
      <h4>Pavise.</h4>
      <p>The master arbalester fights from behind a large, fixed shield called a <em>pavise</em>. The master arbalester may use an action to deploy his pavise in the ground with a spike attached to the bottom. While protected by the pavise, the master arbalester's AC is +5, his dexterity saving throws are +5, and his movement rate is 0. The master arbalester must use one action to stow the pavise on his back, and it may not be wielded in hand to hand combat.</p>
    </property-block>

    <property-block>
      <p>If the master arbalester is subject to an effect that allows him to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, he can use his reaction to take no damage if he succeeds on his saving throw, interposing his pavise between himself and the source of the effect.</p>
    </property-block>



    <property-block>
      <h4>Sharpshooter.</h4>
      <p>Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls. Ranged weapon attack ignore half cover and three-quarters cover. The master arbalester may choose to take a -5 penalty to a ranged weapon attack roll. If the attack hits, add +10 to the attack's damage.</p>

    <h3>Battlesystem</h3>

    <property-block>
      <h4>Regiment.</h4>
      <p>The master arbalester typically joins a <em>regiment</em> stand. When setting up the pavise, the regiment may take the <em>defend</em> configuration.</p>
    </property-block>

    <property-block>
      <h4>Crouching Turtle, Hidden Pavisier.</h4>
      <p>The master arbalester is trained to move in formation at speed while holding his pavise to defend against missile attacks. When in the <em>defend</em> configuration, his stand gains a +5 bonus to AC and moves at full speed.</p>
    </property-block>
