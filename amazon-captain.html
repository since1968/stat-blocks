      <h4>Ares' Own Luck.</h4>
      <p>When she makes an ability check, saving throw, <em>or attack</em> roll, the Amazon can add a d10 to her roll. She can do this after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur. She can't use this feature again until she has finished a long rest.</p>
    </property-block>

    <property-block>
      <h4>Dismounted Sharpshooter.</h4>
      <p>Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls. Ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover. The Amazon may choose to take a -5 penalty to a ranged weapon attack roll. If the attack hits, add +10 to the attack's damage. The Amazon only receives the Sharpshooter feat when she is dismounted.</p>
    </property-block>

    <property-block>
      <h4>Grappler.</h4>
      <p>An Amazon has advantage on attack rolls against a creature she is grappling. An Amazon can use her action to try to pin a creature grappled by her. To do so, make another grapple check. On success, she and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends.</p>
    </property-block>


    <property-block>
      <h4>Martial Advantage.</h4>
      <p>The Amazon can deal an extra 4 (1d6) damage to a creature she hits with a melee weapon attack if that creature is within 5 feet of an ally of the Amazon that isn't incapacitated, and if that creature is a humanoid male.</p>
    </property-block>

    <property-block>
      <h4>Mounted Combatant.</h4>
      <p>While mounted and not incapacitated, the Amazon has advantage on melee attack rolls on any unmounted creature that is smaller than her mount. The Amazon can force an attack targeted at her mount to target her instead. If the Amazon's mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw and only half damage if it fails.</p>
