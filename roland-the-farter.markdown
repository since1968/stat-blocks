> ***Entertainer (Background).*** Roland the Farter has been the center of attention since before he could walk, and once he learned to sing and fart, he never surrendered the spotlight again. And who deserves it more than him?
>
> ***Fool's Insight.*** Roland the Farter can cast detect thoughts up to 4 times before completing a long rest. If the creature resists his attempts to probe deeper and succeeds at its saving throw, it immediately suffers an embarrassing social gaffe.

> ***Spellcasting.*** Roland is a xxth level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following spells prepared:
>
> Cantrips (at-will). mending, minor illusion, vicious mockery.
>
> 1st-level spells (4). charm person, faerie fire, fog cloud, grease.
>
> 2nd-level spells (3). crown of madness, invisibilty, misty step.
>
> 3rd-level spells (3). dispel magic, major image, stinking cloud.

> ### Equipment
> Shortsword, leather armor, set of fine clothes, entertainer's pack, lute, battle carriage, draft horses (4), caltrops, ball bearings.

> ### Reactions
> ***Cutting Words.*** Use bardic inspiration die to subtract from a creature’s attack roll, ability check, or damage roll.

> ### Actions

> ***Countercharm.*** Roland can start a performance that lasts until the end of his next turn. Any friendly creatures within 30 feet of him have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.

> ***Attack.*** Roland the Farter makes one melee or ranged weapon attack.

> ***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

> ***Fart.*** Roland can fart at will. Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) poison damage. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be subject to the poisoned condition for one round.

> ### Bonus Actions

> ***Tumble.*** When he tumbles, Roland gains the benefits of taking the Dash and Disengage actions; gains a climbing speed equal to his current speed; and takes half damage from falling.

> ***Bardic Inspiration.*** Add a d8 to a creature’s ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.

> Roland the Farter travels with a troupe of 7 entertainers (actually a mix of *bandit captains* and thieves) in a battle wagon. His troupe pilfers the audience while he performs. If caught, he is reluctant to fight, preferring to slip away via misty step, grease, and noxious cloud (in a pinch).
