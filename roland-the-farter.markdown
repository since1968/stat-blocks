> ### Actions

> ***Countercharm.*** Roland can start a performance that lasts until the end of his next turn. Any friendly creatures within 30 feet of him have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.

> ***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

> ***Fart.*** Roland can fart at will. Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) poison damage. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be subject to the poisoned condition for one round.


> ### Reactions
> ***Cutting Words.*** Use bardic inspiration die to subtract from a creature’s attack roll, ability check, or damage roll.


> ### Bonus Actions

> ***Tumble.*** When he tumbles, Roland gains the benefits of taking the Dash and Disengage actions; gains a climbing speed equal to his current speed; and takes half damage from falling.

> ***Bardic Inspiration.*** Add a d8 to a creature’s ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.


Roland travels with a troupe of seven entertainers (actually a mix of *bandit captains* and thieves) in a battle wagon. His troupe pilfers the audience while he performs. If caught, he is reluctant to fight, preferring to slip away via misty step, grease, and noxious cloud (in a pinch).

# Appendix

### Sources
The Stiletto archetype was inspired by Guy Windsor's excellent course [The Medieval Dagger](http://swordschool.teachable.com/p/the-medieval-dagger). You can see him perform medieval dagger maneuvers at his [Sword School](https://www.youtube.com/user/swordschool). Any errors in abstracting medieval dagger fighting for D&D are mine, not his.

The archetype is a pastiche of martial strikers. Most of the maneuvers are taken from earlier D&D editions and updated for 5e. Sources include:

* Complete Warrior
* Into the Unknown
* Martial Power 1 & 2
* Player's Handbook
* Tome of Battle
* [Unearthed Arcana](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/unearthed-arcana)
* Image: Katenspiel Streit, Jan Steen (1625/1626–1679), via Wikimedia Commons

The *Ligadura Mezana* is a real lock and counter maneuver documented by [Fiore dei Liberi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiore_dei_Liberi).

```
```

### To Do

I have play-tested the Stiletto through 3rd level. On paper, the archetype appears overpowered, but plays surprisingly well. Its ability to impose unfavorable conditions makes up for its lack of "almost always on" sneak attacks, but the maneuver save DC is low enough (assuming a standard point array) that your opponents will frequently overcome them. To do:

* Play-test beyond 3rd level.
* Create more basic maneuvers based on real dagger maneuvers in Fiore, without re-introducing "called shots" from earlier editions.
* Create more signature maneuvers.
