    <property-block>
      <h4>Crossbow Expert.</h4>
      <p>The balistriere a cavallo ignores the loading property of a heavy crossbow. Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature does not impose disadvantage on a ranged attack roll.</p>
    </property-block>


    <property-block>
      <h4>Martial Advantage.</h4>
      <p>The balistriere a cavallo has advantage on a ranged attack roll against a creature if at least one of the balistriere a cavallo's allies is within 5 feet and isn't incapacitated.</p>
    </property-block>

    <property-block>
      <h4>Dismounted Sharpshooter.</h4>
      <p>Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls. Ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover. The balistriere a cavallo may choose to take a -5 penalty to a ranged weapon attack roll. If the attack hits, add +10 to the attack's damage. The balistiere a cavallo may only use the Sharpshooter feat when he is dismounted.</p>
    </property-block>



    <property-block>
      <h4>Mounted Combatant.</h4>
      <p>The balistriere a cavallo has advantage on melee attack rolls against any unmounted creature that is smaller than his mount. He can force an attack targeted at his mount to target him instead. If his mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw and only half damage if it fails.</p>

      <h4>Born to the Saddle.</h4>
      <p>The balistriere a cavallo has advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off his mount. If he falls off his mount, he always lands on his feet if he is capable of taking actions. Mounting or dismounting his warhorse only costs him 5 feet of movement, rather than half his speed.</p>
    </property-block>


    <h3>Actions</h3>

    <property-block>
      <h4>Multiattack.</h4>
      <p>When dismounted, the balistriere a cavallo makes two heavy crossbow attacks or one melee weapon attack. When mounted, the balistriere a cavallo is limited to one ranged weapon attack or one melee weapon attack.</p>
    </property-block>


    <property-block>
      <h4>Heavy Crossbow.</h4>
      <p><i>Ranged Weapon Attack:</i> +5 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target.
        <i>Hit:</i> 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage.</p>
    </property-block>



    <property-block>
      <h4>Shortsword.</h4>
      <p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.</p>
    </property-block>


    <property-block>
      <h4>Dagger.</h4>
      <p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.</p>
    </property-block>


    <h3>Battlesystem</h3>

    <property-block>
      <h4>Skirmisher.</h4>
      <p>The balistriere a cavallo typically joins a <em>skirmisher</em> stand.</p>

	<p>After seeing the potency of the Amazons, Hatchibombator trained and outfitted 20 pavisiers to fight as cavalry. Expensive to outfit and maintain--and able to deal enormous damage at range--balistriere a cavallo are among the elite of any army.</p>
